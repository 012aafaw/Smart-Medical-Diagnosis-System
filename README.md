# Disease Prediction System - ML-Based Diagnosis Tool

 ðŸ“Œ Project Description

*Disease Prediction System* is a machine learning-powered web application that helps predict potential diseases based on patient-reported symptoms. This tool serves as a preliminary diagnostic assistant for educational purposes.

 âœ¨ Key Features

- ðŸ©º *Symptom-based prediction*: Users can select multiple symptoms from an organized checklist
- ðŸ¤– *ML-powered*: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier trained on medical data
- ðŸ“Š *Probability analysis*: Shows top 3 likely diseases with probability percentages
- ðŸ‘¤ *Patient profile*: Considers age and gender in the analysis
- ðŸŽ¨ *User-friendly interface*: Clean, Arabic-optimized UI with visual progress indicators

 ðŸ›  Technical Details

- *Algorithm*: Random Forest Classifier (Scikit-learn)
- *Data*: Trained on comprehensive symptom-disease dataset
- *Framework*: Streamlit for web interface
- *Languages*: Python (Backend), HTML/CSS (UI enhancements)
